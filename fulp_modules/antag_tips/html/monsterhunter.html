	<p>Awoken from your retirement due to the presence of unholy creatures, you have a handful of abilities to deal with them.</p>
	<p><img src="coffin.png"/>You need a coffin to gain abilities, level up and protect yourself from Sol. In extreme cases, a locker or crate will serve for the latter.</p>
	<p>Night has a duration of 10 minutes, and Sol strikes after that duration for 90 seconds.</p>
	<p>Sol will burn you if you aren't in a coffin while it's ocurring, possibly to lethal levels if you're an elder bloodsucker.</p>
	<p><img src="pers_rack.png"/>As a bloodsucker, you can make crew members addicted to your blood to serve you using a persuasion rack, becoming your </b>vassals</b>. You can create a persuasion rack in the crafting menu after claiming a coffin.</p>
	<p>Be cautious, as there might be monster hunters onboard seeking to end your existence<img src="monsterhunter.png"/>.</p>
